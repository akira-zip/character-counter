## About the project
It was a test to improve my HTML and CSS skills with NextJS, but also for start to deepen my TypeScript skills. This project made me understand a bit of interfaces, modified props and client rendering. It will change at the future.

## What will change?
- **Word detection: Which words are repeating in any text**
